# my_exercism_solutions
This is my exercism progress (exercism.io is a website with exercises to learn programming languages with). I'm working through their Rust track. 

Most of these solutions should be pretty decent. They're all complete (except PASS i/o) and correct, I'd like to think they're pretty readable/straightforward, and while I haven't done any benchmarking, most of them shouldn't be far from optimal.
